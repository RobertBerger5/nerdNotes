# nerdNotes
The goal here is to make an application where the user can easily create notecards for research purposes.
These notecards can be moved around the screen and grouped, as well as having tags to sort by.
Then I will have it save to some easily readable/writeable file to save changes and come back later.
This readme is now an experiment for how many sentences I can start with "T" and still have it sound natural.
That's about all I got.
Til later,
Thanks for reading
